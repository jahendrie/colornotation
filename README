1.  What is this?

    colornotation.py is a Python script to be used in conjunction with the
    Android 'ColorNote' app.  It makes it easier to create ColorNote notes (HTML
    files) on your computer, which you can then use within the app itself by
    transferring the note to your phone (email, Dropbox, whatever).

    If you prefer typing on a physical keyboard but still want the note with you
    when you're out and about, here you go.  The sky's the limit, assuming of
    course that your sky does not extend beyond the capabilities of a basic
    note-taking Android app or this simple Python script.


2.  Install / Uninstall

    No installation.  Just a quick Python script that I wrote in a couple of
    hours.  Mark it executable and stick it somewhere in your $PATH, or execute
    it locally whenever the mood strikes you.


3.  How do I use it?

    ./colornotation.py [OPTIONS] [ITEMS]

    ITEMS are arguments provided by you that will be added to the note.  If you
    just want a quick note, enclose your text in quotes (i.e., "dog dead; throw
    away blanket").  Typically, it's better to either pipe your input from stdin
    or specify an infile to be parsed.

    Options:
        -h or --help:       Print help
        --version:          Version and author info
        -t or --title:      Specify the title of your note
        -l or --list:       List format
        -i or --input:      Select input file (default is STDIN)
        -o or --output:     Select output file (default is STDOUT)
        -s or --strip:      Strip a ColorNote note of its HTML.  This can also
                            remove the checkboxes if used in tandem with the
                            --list option.
            
    Examples:

        ./colornotation -l -i shopping-list.txt -o shopping-list.html
            Turn 'shopping-list.txt' into an HTML file that ColorNote can use
            named shopping-list.html.

        cat shopping-list.txt | ./colornotation --list -t "Shopping" > list.html
            Same as above, except the list is titled "Shopping" and instead of
            specifying input/output, input is piped into the script and
            redirected to list.html.

        ./colornotation article.txt > article.html
            Create a note from an article.  I have no idea how large ColorNote
            note files are allowed to be, so try not to get crazy with this sort
            of thing.

        cat note.html | ./colornotation -sl -o note.txt
            Strip note.html (presumably sent to yourself from the ColorNote app)
            of its HTML and list formatting, writing the resultant text to the
            file note.txt

        ./colornotation -sl --input=note.html --output=note.txt
            Same as above, except using long-format input/output args.
